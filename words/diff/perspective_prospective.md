Perspective or Prospective?
=============================================

*Perspective* means "point of view, especially the ability to see the whole of something." In art, it specifically means the ability to present three dimensional objects using a two dimensional medium. *Perspective* is normally a noun.

The prefix *per-* means "completely."

*Prospective* means "future or potential" and is normally an adjective. The noun form is *prospect*.

The prefix *pro-* means "forward."

The Latin root of both words, *-spect-*, means "to see." So *perspective* literally means "seeing completely" and *prospective* means "seeing ahead."
